            Did you know that purchasing vehicles at this kind of auction directly is the most reliable way to find and
            obtain what you need?
        </h4>
        <p class="">
            Every vehicle goes through a comprehensive inspection before an auction opens by the auction houses'
            professional car inspectors. This is done by performing a comprehensive inspection of the mechanical
            condition, body condition, and interior condition of a vehicle and their findings are filled out on an
            auction sheet. This professional inspection not only uncovers obvious damages, but also any kind of hidden
            problems, such as flood damage, odometer rollback or the even the vehicle having been salvaged, all this
            major details will also be noted on the auction sheet.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Many import dealers are not so willing to disclose the "Auction Sheet" for a particular vehicle they mean to
            sell to a customer even if the vehicle has been bought through the Japanese Car Auction including with it
            the "Auction Sheet". Since the "Auction Sheet" gives an awareness to the customer of the hidden problems
            with the vehicle. There are too many lemons in this market, which have been imported by the countries all
            over the world and which are sold at massive profits.

            - You can know condition of a vehicle through an auction sheet i.e. an inspection report by a professional
            car inspector.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-semibold">
            - You can know every thing about the vehicle. The auction sheet shows you even all the hidden problems for
            that particular car.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-semibold mb-0">
            - This inspection report is a declaration of the condition of the vehicle to the customer to know the
            overall of the vehicle they're about to invest in.

            In order to full understand the kind of inspection they perform, an auction grade is given indicating the
            vehicle's condition and is included on the auction sheet. The auction grade of a vehicle is an index of a
            vehicle's overall condition. You can know the general, rough condition of the vehicle through this auction
            grade and the vehicle's diagram that is also included in the auction sheet, even if you are unable to read
            Japanese, which is one of the benefits of having an auction sheet.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
            Each auction sheet however includes notes by the inspector, an inspector's report which includes important
            information on a vehicle's condition e.g. major mechanical trouble, such as engine knocking, a slipping
            transmission, or major body problems, such as major accident damage or major rust damage. This information
            would provide you with a clearer picture of the true condition of the vehicle, allowing you to make a more
            informed decision concerning your purchase, yet this inspector's report is written in Japanese.
